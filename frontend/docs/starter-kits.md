# Starter kits

Generally, for our single-page apps we use [React](https://reactjs.org) with tooling provided by [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). For React apps with server-side rendering, we use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

- A frontend starter kit with SSR support powered by Next.js is available (**crucible**)
