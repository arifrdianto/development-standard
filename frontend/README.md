# Kata Platform Development Standard - Frontend

## Overview

This is a living document outlining guidelines for developing frontend projects within Kata.ai, as well as the tools we use. You can read about the styleguide we follow and the tools we use below.

## Starter kits

Generally, for our single-page apps we use [React](https://reactjs.org) with tooling provided by [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). For React apps with server-side rendering, we use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

- A frontend starter kit with SSR support powered by Next.js is available (**crucible**)
