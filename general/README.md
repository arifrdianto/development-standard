# Kata Platform Development Standard - General Guidelines

## Overview

This is a living document outlining the general guidelines for developing services and tools within the Kata Platform. You can read about the styleguide we follow and the languages/tools we use below.

## See also

- [TypeScript Guidelines](./docs/typescript-guidelines.md) - for our General TypeScript Guidelines.
- [Go Guidelines](./docs/go-guidelines.md) - for our General Go Guidelines.

## Starter kits

Both the front-end team and the back-end team provide their own starter kits. This allows you to both learn how to write code according to our styleguide, and to quickstart on a new project internally.

Check each teams' guidelines to find them.

## Languages

The following section lists the languages generally approved for use within the Kata Platform environment. If you want to add your own language into the Development Standard, don't hesitate to pitch them to your superiors.

### TypeScript

At Kata.ai, we use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) across our entire JavaScript stack. TypeScript combines the familiarity of JavaScript with the power of static typing.

In general, using static typing in your JavaScript code [can help prevent about 15%](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/09/19/to-type-or-not-to-type-quantifying-detectable-bugs-in-javascript/) of the bugs that end up in committed code. Not only static typing, TypeScript also provides various productivity enhancements like advanced statement completion, as well as smart code refactoring.
